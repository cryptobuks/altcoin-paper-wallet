A pretty HTML template for printing a multi currency cold crypto wallet with
QR codes.

Usage:
1) Download HTML and JS onto a secure, single-use computer to be used for
offline wallet generation.
2) Go offline. Generate your wallets (with other tools).
3) Open the HTML. Cut and paste the addresses & keys in. QR codes are
automatically generated.
4) Print. Nuke the computer & printer.

Advanced:
Edit the HTML directly to add/remove currencies from the template.

TIP: Consider BIP-0032 & BIP-0044 as a more sophisticated & powerful
alternative.
